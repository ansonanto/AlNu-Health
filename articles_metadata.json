        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Skeletal muscle atrophy is defined as a reduction of muscle mass caused by excessive protein degradation. However, the development of therapeutic interventions is still in an early stage. Although glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, such as exendin-4 (Ex-4) and dulaglutide, are widely used for the treatment of diabetes, their effects on muscle pathology are unknown. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of GLP-1R agonist for muscle wasting and the mechanisms involved.\nMETHODS: Mouse C2C12 myotubes were used to evaluate the in vitro effects of Ex-4 in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (Dex) on the regulation of the expression of muscle atrophic factors and the underlying mechanisms using various pharmacological inhibitors. In addition, we investigated the in vivo therapeutic effect of Ex-4 in a Dex-induced mouse muscle atrophy model (20 mg/kg/day i.p.) followed by injection of Ex-4 (100 ng/day i.p.) for 12 days and chronic kidney disease (CKD)-induced muscle atrophy model. Furthermore, we evaluated the effect of a long-acting GLP-1R agonist by treatment of dulaglutide (1 mg/kg/week s.c.) for 3 weeks, in DBA/2J-mdx mice, a Duchenne muscular dystrophy model.\nRESULTS: Ex-4 suppressed the expression of myostatin (MSTN) and muscle atrophic factors such as F-box only protein 32 (atrogin-1) and muscle RING-finger protein-1 (MuRF-1) in Dex-treated C2C12 myotubes. The suppression effect was via protein kinase A and protein kinase B signalling pathways through GLP-1R. In addition, Ex-4 treatment inhibited glucocorticoid receptor (GR) translocation by up-regulating the proteins of GR inhibitory complexes. In a Dex-induced muscle atrophy model, Ex-4 ameliorated muscle atrophy by suppressing muscle atrophic factors and enhancing myogenic factors (MyoG and MyoD), leading to increased muscle mass and function. In the CKD muscle atrophy model, Ex-4 also increased muscle mass, myofiber size, and muscle function. In addition, treatment with a long-acting GLP-1R agonist, dulaglutide, recovered muscle mass and function in DBA/2J-mdx mice.\nCONCLUSIONS: GLP-1R agonists ameliorate muscle wasting by suppressing MSTN and muscle atrophic factors and enhancing myogenic factors through GLP-1R-mediated signalling pathways. These novel findings suggest that activating GLP-1R signalling may be useful for the treatment of atrophy-related muscular diseases.",

        "abstract": "Sarcopenia is an age-related clinical complaint characterized by the progressive deterioration of skeletal muscle mass and strength over time. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with faster and more relevant skeletal muscle impairment. Both conditions influence each other, leading to negative consequences on glycemic control, cardiovascular risk, general health status, risk of falls, frailty, overall quality of life, and mortality. PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for research articles, scientific reports, observational studies, clinical trials, narrative and systematic reviews, and meta-analyses to review the evidence on the pathophysiology of di-abetes-induced sarcopenia, its relevance in terms of glucose control and diabetes-related outcomes, and diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The review comprehensively addresses key elements for the clinical definition and diagnostic criteria of sarcopenia, the pathophysiological correlation be-tween T2D, sarcopenia, and related outcomes, a critical review of the role of antihyperglycemic treatment on skeletal muscle health, and perspectives on the role of specific treatment targeting myokine signaling pathways involved in glucose control and the regulation of skeletal muscle metabolism and trophism. Prompt diagnosis and adequate management, including lifestyle inter-vention, health diet programs, micronutrient supplementation, physical exercise, and pharmaco-logical treatment, are needed to prevent or delay skeletal muscle deterioration in T2D.",

        "abstract": "The rapid and widespread clinical adoption of highly effective incretin-mimetic drugs (IMDs), particularly semaglutide and tirzepatide, for the treatment of obesity has outpaced the updating of clinical practice guidelines. Consequently, many patients may be at risk for adverse effects and uncertain long-term outcomes related to the use of these drugs. Of emerging concern is the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function that can accompany rapid substantial weight reduction; such losses can lead to reduced functional and metabolic health, weight cycling, compromised quality of life, and other adverse outcomes. Available evidence suggests that clinical trial participants receiving IMDs for the treatment of obesity lost 10% or more of their muscle mass during the 68- to 72-week interventions, approximately equivalent to 20\u2009years of age-related muscle loss. The ability to maintain muscle mass during caloric restriction-induced weight reduction is influenced by two key factors: nutrition and physical exercise. Nutrition therapy should ensure adequate intake and absorption of high-quality protein and micronutrients, which may require the use of oral nutritional supplements. Additionally, concurrent physical activity, especially resistance training, has been shown to effectively minimize loss of muscle mass and function during weight reduction therapy. All patients receiving IMDs for obesity should participate in comprehensive treatment programs emphasizing adequate protein and micronutrient intakes, as well as resistance training, to preserve muscle mass and function, maximize the benefit of IMD therapy, and minimize potential risks.",

However, uncertainty regarding kidney outcomes persists and whether benefits extend to exendin-4-based GLP-1 receptor remains uncertain. We aimed to meta-analyse the most up-to-date evidence on the cardiovascular benefits and risks of GLP-1 receptor agonists from outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS: We did a meta-analysis, including new data from AMPLITUDE-O, using a random effects model to estimate overall hazard ratio (HR) for MACE; its components; all-cause mortality; hospital admission for heart failure; a composite kidney outcome consisting of development of macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, or at least 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), kidney replacement therapy, or death due to kidney disease; worsening of kidney function, based on eGFR change; and odds ratios for key safety outcomes (severe hypoglycaemia, retinopathy, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer). We also examined MACE outcome in patient subgroups on the basis of MACE incidence rates in the placebo group, presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, HbA\nFINDINGS: Of 98 articles screened, eight trials comprising 60\u2009080 patients fulfilled the prespecified criteria and were included. Overall, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced MACE by 14% (HR 0\u00b786 [95% CI 0\u00b780-0\u00b793]; p<0\u00b70001), with no significant heterogeneity across GLP-1 receptor agonist structural homology or eight other examined subgroups (all p\nINTERPRETATION: GLP-1 receptor agonists, regardless of structural homology, reduced the risk of individual MACE components, all-cause mortality, hospital admission for heart failure, and worsening kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes.\nFUNDING: None.",

        "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a multifactorial condition related to the loss of muscle mass and strength due to aging, eating habits, physical inactivity, or even caused by another disease. Affected individuals have a higher risk of falls and may be associated with heart disease, respiratory diseases, cognitive impairment, and consequently an increased risk of hospitalization, in addition to causing an economic impact due to the high cost of care during the stay in hospitals. The standardization of appropriate treatment for patients with sarcopenia that could help reduce pathology-related morbidity is necessary. For these reasons, this study aimed to perform a systematic review of the role of nutrition and drugs that could ameliorate the health and quality of life of sarcopenic patients and PRISMA guidelines were followed. Lifestyle interventions have shown a profound impact on sarcopenia treatment but using supplements and different drugs can also impact skeletal muscle maintenance. Creatine, leucine, branched-chain amino acids, omega 3, and vitamin D can show benefits. Although with controversial results, medications such as Metformin, GLP-1, losartan, statin, growth hormone, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors have also been considered and can alter the sarcopenic's metabolic parameters, protect against cardiovascular diseases and outcomes, while protecting muscles.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clozapine and olanzapine are some of the most effective antipsychotics, but both are associated with weight gain and relevant metabolic disturbances, including pre-diabetes and diabetes. Non-pharmacological/behavioural interventions have had limited effects counteracting these adverse effects. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. We will investigate the long-term effects of add-on treatment with semaglutide once a week versus placebo once a week on the metabolic status in pre-diabetic (glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 35-47\u2009mmol/mol (5.4%-6.4%) and diabetic (HbA1c 48-57\u2009mmol/mol (6.5%-7.4%)) patients diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder who initiated clozapine or olanzapine treatment within the last 60 months.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a 26-week, double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. Altogether, 104 patients diagnosed with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, aged 18-65 years, with pre-diabetes or diabetes will be randomised to injections of 1.0\u2009mg semaglutide once a week or placebo for 26 weeks. The primary endpoint is change from baseline in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints include changes in body weight, hip and waist circumference and plasma levels of insulin, glucagon, glucose, and C-peptide, insulin sensitivity, beta cell function, hepatic function, fibrosis-4 score, lipid profile, incretin hormones, bone markers, body composition, bone density, proteomic analyses and oxidative stress markers. Together with alcohol, tobacco and drug use, potential effects on the reward value of a sweet-fat stimulus, psychopathology, level of activity and quality of life will also be assessed.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is approved by the Danish Medicines Agency and the regional scientific ethics committee of the Capital Region of Denmark (committee C, #H-20019008) and will be carried out in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Helsinki Declaration. The results will be disseminated through peer-review publications and conference presentations.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04892199.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Regulatory guidance specifies the need to establish cardiovascular safety of new diabetes therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes in order to rule out excess cardiovascular risk. The cardiovascular effects of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue with an extended half-life of approximately 1 week, in type 2 diabetes are unknown.\nMETHODS: We randomly assigned 3297 patients with type 2 diabetes who were on a standard-care regimen to receive once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) or placebo for 104 weeks. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. We hypothesized that semaglutide would be noninferior to placebo for the primary outcome. The noninferiority margin was 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio.\nRESULTS: At baseline, 2735 of the patients (83.0%) had established cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or both. The primary outcome occurred in 108 of 1648 patients (6.6%) in the semaglutide group and in 146 of 1649 patients (8.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 2.9% of the patients receiving semaglutide and in 3.9% of those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.08; P=0.12); nonfatal stroke occurred in 1.6% and 2.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99; P=0.04). Rates of death from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups. Rates of new or worsening nephropathy were lower in the semaglutide group, but rates of retinopathy complications (vitreous hemorrhage, blindness, or conditions requiring treatment with an intravitreal agent or photocoagulation) were significantly higher (hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.78; P=0.02). Fewer serious adverse events occurred in the semaglutide group, although more patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high cardiovascular risk, the rate of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke was significantly lower among patients receiving semaglutide than among those receiving placebo, an outcome that confirmed the noninferiority of semaglutide.

        "abstract": "The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) semaglutide is the most recently approved agent of this drug class, and the only GLP-1RA currently available as both subcutaneous and oral formulation. While GLP-1RAs effectively improve glycemic control and cause weight loss, potential safety concerns have arisen over the years. For semaglutide, such concerns have been addressed in the extensive phase 3 registration trials including cardiovascular outcome trials for both subcutaneous (SUSTAIN: Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes) and oral (PIONEER: Peptide InnOvatioN for the Early diabEtes tReatment) semaglutide and are being studied in further trials and registries, including real world data studies. In the current review we discuss the occurrence of adverse events associated with semaglutide focusing on hypoglycemia, gastrointestinal side effects, pancreatic safety (pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer), thyroid cancer, gallbladder events, cardiovascular aspects, acute kidney injury, diabetic retinopathy (DRP) complications and injection-site and allergic reactions and where available, we highlight potential underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, we discuss whether effects are specific for semaglutide or a class effect. We conclude that semaglutide induces mostly mild-to-moderate and transient gastrointestinal disturbances and increases the risk of biliary disease (cholelithiasis). No unexpected safety issues have arisen to date, and the established safety profile for semaglutide is similar to that of other GLP-1RAs where definitive conclusions for pancreatic and thyroid cancer cannot be drawn at this point due to low incidence of these conditions. Due to its potent glucose-lowering effect, patients at risk for deterioration of existing DRP should be carefully monitored if treated with semaglutide, particularly if also treated with insulin. Given the beneficial metabolic and cardiovascular actions of semaglutide, and the low risk for severe adverse events, semaglutide has an overall favorable risk/benefit profile for patient with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; semaglutide and others) now promises effective, non-invasive treatment of obesity for individuals with and without diabetes. Social media platforms' users started promoting semaglutide/Ozempic as a weight-loss treatment, and the associated increase in demand has contributed to an ongoing worldwide shortage of the drug associated with levels of non-prescribed semaglutide intake. Furthermore, recent reports emphasized some GLP-1 RA-associated risks of triggering depression and suicidal thoughts. Consistent with the above, we aimed to assess the possible impact of GLP-1 RAs on mental health as being perceived and discussed in popular open platforms with the help of a mixed-methods approach. Reddit posts yielded 12,136 comments, YouTube videos 14,515, and TikTok videos 17,059, respectively. Out of these posts/entries, most represented matches related to sleep-related issues, including insomnia (n = 620 matches); anxiety (n = 353); depression (n = 204); and mental health issues in general (n = 165). After the initiation of GLP-1 RAs, losing weight was associated with either a marked improvement or, in some cases, a deterioration, in mood; increase/decrease in anxiety/insomnia; and better control of a range of addictive behaviors. The challenges of accessing these medications were a hot topic as well. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study documenting if and how GLP-1 RAs are perceived as affecting mood, mental health, and behaviors. Establishing a clear cause-and-effect link between metabolic diseases, depression and medications is difficult because of their possible reciprocal relationship, shared underlying mechanisms and individual differences. Further research is needed to better understand the safety profile of these molecules and their putative impact on behavioral and non-behavioral addictions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce food intake, producing remarkable weight loss in overweight and obese individuals. While much of this weight loss is fat mass, there is also a loss of lean mass, similar to other approaches that induce calorie deficit. Targeting signaling pathways that regulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a promising avenue to preserve lean mass and modulate body composition. Myostatin and Activin A are TGF\u03b2-like ligands that signal via the activin type II receptors (ActRII) to antagonize muscle growth. Pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrate that ActRII blockade induces skeletal muscle hypertrophy and reduces fat mass. In this manuscript, we test the hypothesis that combined ActRII blockade and GLP-1 receptor agonism will preserve muscle mass, leading to improvements in skeletomuscular and metabolic function and enhanced fat loss.\nMETHODS: In this study, we explore the therapeutic potential of bimagrumab, a monoclonal antibody against ActRII, to modify body composition alone and during weight loss induced by GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide in diet-induced obese mice. Mechanistically, we define the specific role of the anabolic kinase Akt in mediating the hypertrophic muscle effects of ActRII inhibition in\u00a0vivo.\nRESULTS: Treatment of obese mice with bimagrumab induced a \u223c10\u00a0% increase in lean mass while simultaneously decreasing fat mass. Daily treatment of obese mice with semaglutide potently decreased body weight; this included a significant decrease in both muscle and fat mass. Combination treatment with bimagrumab and semaglutide led to superior fat mass loss while simultaneously preserving lean mass despite reduced food intake. Treatment with both drugs was associated with improved metabolic outcomes, and increased lean mass was associated with improved exercise performance. Deletion of both Akt isoforms in skeletal muscle modestly reduced, but did not prevent, muscle hypertrophy driven by ActRII inhibition.\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data demonstrate that blockade of ActRII signaling improves body composition and metabolic parameters during calorie deficit driven by GLP-1 receptor agonism and demonstrate the existence of Akt-independent pathways supporting muscle hypertrophy in the absence of ActRII signaling.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is related to the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function (sarcopenia). The co-existence of obesity and sarcopenia is called sarcopenic obesity (SO). Glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are widely used in the treatment of diabetes and obesity. However, the protective effects of GLP-1RA on skeletal muscle in obesity and SO are not clear. This study investigated the effects of GLP-1RA liraglutide and semaglutide on obesity-induced muscle atrophy and explored the underlying mechanisms.\nMETHODS: Thirty-six male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into two groups and fed a regular diet and a high-fat diet for 18 weeks, respectively. After establishing an obesity model, mice were further divided into six groups: control group, liraglutide (LIRA) group, semaglutide (SEMA) group, high-fat diet (HFD) group, HFD + LIRA group, HFD + SEMA group, and subcutaneous injection for 4 weeks. The body weight, muscle mass, muscle strength, glycolipid metabolism, muscle atrophy markers, myogenic differentiation markers, GLUT4 and SIRT1 were analyzed. C2C12 myotube cells treated with palmitic acid (PA) were divided into four groups: control group, PA group, PA + LIRA group, PA + SEMA group. The changes in glucose uptake, myotube diameter, lipid droplet infiltration, markers of muscle atrophy, myogenic differentiation markers, GLUT4 and SIRT1 were analyzed, and the changes in related indicators were observed after the addition of SIRT1 inhibitor EX527.\nRESULTS: Liraglutide and semaglutide reduced HFD-induced body weight gain, excessive lipid accumulation and improved muscle atrophy. Liraglutide and semaglutide eliminated the increase of muscle atrophy markers in skeletal muscle and C2C12 myotubes. Liraglutide and semaglutide restored impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance. However, these beneficial effects were attenuated by inhibiting SIRT1 expression.\nCONCLUSION: Liraglutide and semaglutide protects skeletal muscle against obesity-induced muscle atrophy via the SIRT1 pathway.",

        "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is closely associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including atherosclerosis, hypertension and heart failure. Some anti-diabetic medications are linked with an increased risk of weight gain or hypoglycemia which may reduce the efficacy of the intended anti-hyperglycemic effects of these therapies. The recently developed receptor agonists for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1RAs), stimulate insulin secretion and reduce glycated hemoglobin levels without having side effects such as weight gain and hypoglycemia. In addition, GLP1-RAs demonstrate numerous cardiovascular protective effects in subjects with or without diabetes. There have been several cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) involving GLP-1RAs, which have supported the overall cardiovascular benefits of these drugs. GLP1-RAs lower plasma lipid levels and lower blood pressure (BP), both of which contribute to a reduction of atherosclerosis and reduced CVD. GLP-1R is expressed in multiple cardiovascular cell types such as monocyte/macrophages, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes. Recent studies have indicated that the protective properties against endothelial dysfunction, anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages and the anti-proliferative action on smooth muscle cells may contribute to atheroprotection through GLP-1R signaling. In the present review, we describe the cardiovascular effects and underlying molecular mechanisms of action of GLP-1RAs in CVOTs, animal models and cultured cells, and address how these findings have transformed our understanding of the pharmacotherapy of T2DM and the prevention of CVD.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Obesity affects approximately 42% of US adults and is associated with increased rates of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, osteoarthritis, and premature death.\nOBSERVATIONS: A body mass index (BMI) of 25 or greater is commonly used to define overweight, and a BMI of 30 or greater to define obesity, with lower thresholds for Asian populations (BMI \u226525-27.5), although use of BMI alone is not recommended to determine individual risk. Individuals with obesity have higher rates of incident cardiovascular disease. In men with a BMI of 30 to 39, cardiovascular event rates are 20.21 per 1000 person-years compared with 13.72 per 1000 person-years in men with a normal BMI. In women with a BMI of 30 to 39.9, cardiovascular event rates are 9.97 per 1000 person-years compared with 6.37 per 1000 person-years in women with a normal BMI. Among people with obesity, 5% to 10% weight loss improves systolic blood pressure by about 3 mm Hg for those with hypertension, and may decrease hemoglobin A1c by 0.6% to 1% for those with type 2 diabetes. Evidence-based obesity treatment includes interventions addressing 5 major categories: behavioral interventions, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic/bariatric procedures. Comprehensive obesity care plans combine appropriate interventions for individual patients. Multicomponent behavioral interventions, ideally consisting of at least 14 sessions in 6 months to promote lifestyle changes, including components such as weight self-monitoring, dietary and physical activity counseling, and problem solving, often produce 5% to 10% weight loss, although weight regain occurs in 25% or more of participants at 2-year follow-up. Effective nutritional approaches focus on reducing total caloric intake and dietary strategies based on patient preferences. Physical activity without calorie reduction typically causes less weight loss (2-3 kg) but is important for weight-loss maintenance. Commonly prescribed medications such as antidepressants (eg, mirtazapine, amitriptyline) and antihyperglycemics such as glyburide or insulin cause weight gain, and clinicians should review and consider alternatives. Antiobesity medications are recommended for nonpregnant patients with obesity or overweight and weight-related comorbidities in conjunction with lifestyle modifications. Six medications are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for long-term use: glucagon-like peptide receptor 1 (GLP-1) agonists (semaglutide and liraglutide only), tirzepatide (a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 agonist), phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion, and orlistat. Of these, tirzepatide has the greatest effect, with mean weight loss of 21% at 72 weeks. Endoscopic procedures (ie, intragastric balloon and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty) can attain 10% to 13% weight loss at 6 months. Weight loss from metabolic and bariatric surgeries (ie, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) ranges from 25% to 30% at 12 months. Maintaining long-term weight loss is difficult, and clinical guidelines support the use of long-term antiobesity medications when weight maintenance is inadequate with lifestyle interventions alone.\nCONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Obesity affects approximately 42% of adults in the US. Behavioral interventions can attain approximately 5% to 10% weight loss, GLP-1 agonists and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/GLP-1 receptor agonists can attain approximately 8% to 21% weight loss, and bariatric surgery can attain approximately 25% to 30% weight loss. Comprehensive, evidence-based obesity treatment combines behavioral interventions, nutrition, physical activity, pharmacotherapy, and metabolic/bariatric procedures as appropriate for individual patients.",

        "abstract": "Tirzepatide is a new molecule capable of controlling glucose blood levels by combining the dual agonism of Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors. GIP and GLP1 are incretin hormones: they are released in the intestine in response to nutrient intake and stimulate pancreatic beta cell activity secreting insulin. GIP and GLP1 also have other metabolic functions. GLP1, in particular, reduces food intake and delays gastric emptying. Moreover, Tirzepatide has been shown to improve blood pressure and to reduce Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides. Tirzepatide efficacy and safety were assessed in a phase III SURPASS 1-5 clinical trial program. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration approved Tirzepatide subcutaneous injections as monotherapy or combination therapy, with diet and physical exercise, to achieve better glycemic blood levels in patients with diabetes. Other clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate its use in other diseases. The scientific interest toward this novel, first-in-class medication is rapidly increasing. In this comprehensive and systematic review, we summarize the main results of the clinical trials investigating Tirzepatide and the currently available meta-analyses, emphasizing novel insights into its adoption in clinical practice for diabetes and its future potential applications in cardiovascular medicine.",

A systematic examination of publications since 2018 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on social determinants of health, the health care system, and physical activity behaviors, including sleep. There is a greater emphasis on weight management as part of the holistic approach to diabetes management. The results of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes trials involving sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, including assessment of subgroups, inform broader recommendations for cardiorenal protection in people with diabetes at high risk of cardiorenal disease. After a summary listing of consensus recommendations, practical tips for implementation are provided.",

        "abstract": "AIM: This review aims to summarize and discuss some of the most relevant clinical trials in epidemiology, diagnostics, and treatment of hypertension published in 2020 and 2021.\nDATA SYNTHESIS: The trials included in this review are related to hypertension onset age and risk for future cardiovascular disease, reliability of different blood pressure monitoring methods, role of exercise-induced hypertension, treatment of hypertension in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, management of hypertension high-risk patient groups, e.g., in the elderly (\u226580 years) and patients with atrial fibrillation, and the interplay between nutrition and hypertension, as well as recent insights into renal denervation for treatment of hypertension.\nCONCLUSIONS: Hypertension onset age, nighttime blood pressure levels and a riser pattern are relevant for the prognosis of future cardiovascular diseases. The risk of coronary heart disease appears to increase linearly with increasing exercise systolic blood pressure. Renin-angiotensin system blockers are not associated with an increased risk for a severe course of COVID-19. In elderly patients, a risk-benefit assessment of intensified blood pressure control should be individually evaluated. A J-shaped association between cardiovascular disease and achieved blood pressure could also be demonstrated in patients with atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation. Salt restriction and lifestyle modification remain effective options in treating hypertensive patients at low cardiovascular risk. Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists show BP-lowering effects. Renal denervation should be considered as an additional or alternative treatment option in selected patients with uncontrolled hypertension.",
