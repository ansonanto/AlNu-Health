**User:** I have type 2 diabetes

**Assistant:** Based on the provided context, individuals with type 2 diabetes often experience insulin resistance and may require higher daily doses of insulin compared to those with type 1 diabetes. Weight management is a key treatment goal, especially since obesity is present in over 90% of people with type 2 diabetes. Medications that promote weight loss, such as tirzepatide and semaglutide, are recommended due to their efficacy in glucose lowering and weight loss. Additionally, lifestyle changes, including weight reduction and physical activity, can improve insulin resistance and potentially lead to diabetes remission. It's important to consider the effects of glucose-lowering medications on weight, as some can promote weight gain and should be used judiciously (dc25s009.pdf, Chunks 101 and 91; dc25s002.pdf, Chunk 71).
